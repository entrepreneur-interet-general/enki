# Installation

This is a little trick to redirect to keycloak from localhost 
```
echo "localhost keycloak" >> /etc/hosts
```
or add it manually with your bests text editor 

You need to create global default network with 
```
docker network create --driver=bridge enki_default
``` 

# Keycloak
```
cd authentication
```
Copy example.env to .env 
```
cp example.env .env
``` 
Change variables if needed

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up 
```
wait keycloak startup
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.provision.yml run --rm keycloak-provision
```

or with make 
```
make upd && sleep 5 && make provision 
```


Get kong client secret from Keycloak admin in Client section and change it in .env file
# Kong Api Gateway

```
cd kong
```
Copy example.env to .env 
```
cp example.env .env
``` 
Change CLIENT_SECRET with keycloak kong client

``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml setup 
```
wait kong startup 
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.provision.yml run --rm kong-provision
```

or with make 
```
make setup && sleep 5 && make build-provision && make provision 
```

# Backend
```
cd backend
```

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
or with make 
```
make build && make upd && make seed
```

It's now possible to post new "affaires" in postman with this endpoint:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/echanges/messages
```

You can access affairs from:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/enki/v1/affairs?code_insee=77108
```
You also have to start SIG in nexsis/sig/api
```
make install
npm run seed
make start
```

# FrontEnd

cd front
```

```
yarn
```

and run angular
```
ng serve
